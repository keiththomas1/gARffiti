# AR Graffiti

Allows user to place persistent images on any wall/surface.

## Overview

User must enter a URL to load an image from the internet into the app. They can then place that image on any surface that is recognized by ARKit. They can place any number of images. Each one gets an anchor attached to it with the URL for loading by yourself later (or eventually by others). The user can then save their world map and then load it up later to show the images they uploaded.
